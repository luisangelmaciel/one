    <p>After breakfast, Mr. Fogg, accompanied by Aouda, started for the English consulate to have his passport visaed.  As he was going out, he met Passepartout, who asked him if it would not be well, before taking the train, to purchase some dozens of Enfield rifles and Colt's revolvers.  He had been listening to stories of attacks upon the trains by the Sioux and Pawnees.  Mr. Fogg thought it a useless precaution, but told him to do as he thought best, and went on to the consulate.</p>

  <p>He had not proceeded two hundred steps, however, when, "by the greatest chance in the world," he met Fix.  The detective seemed wholly taken by surprise.  What!  Had Mr. Fogg and himself crossed the Pacific together, and not met on the steamer!  At least Fix felt honoured to behold once more the gentleman to whom he owed so much, and, as his business recalled him to Europe, he should be delighted to continue the journey in such pleasant company.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fogg replied that the honour would be his; and the detective&mdash;who was determined not to lose sight of him&mdash;begged permission to accompany them in their walk about San Francisco&mdash;a request which Mr. Fogg readily granted.</p>
