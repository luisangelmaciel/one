Need horror movie recommendations this October? Check out my third annual 31 Nights of Horror calendar. Enjoy the alliteratively-themed days like Bloodthirsty Thursday and WTF Wednesday, inline movie trailers, and links to streaming services where you can watch now; many for free! I have an incredible love for horror movies and I look forward to building this project every year. Happy Halloween!

- No movies can repeat across calendars (one exception) . 
- I must watch every movie before it can be added to the list . 
- Aim for a balance of eras, sub-genres, and languages .
