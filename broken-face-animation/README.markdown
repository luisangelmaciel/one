# Broken Face Animation

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/malcolmTLBC/pen/bVWRWg](https://codepen.io/malcolmTLBC/pen/bVWRWg).

GSAP SVG path animation. 

Yes, this is my face.... use the image trace function on Illustrator to do this to any image, expand, ungroup, then save as an svg. BOOM

Change stagger_val & duration variables to play with the timing. 

Inspired by [ARS](http://codepen.io/ARS/)'s Pen [Shattering Text Animation](http://codepen.io/ARS/pen/pjypwd/).
